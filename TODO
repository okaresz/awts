NOTES
-------------------------

```
Trajectory stuff is incomplete all over the place, probably never will be finished
	Section classes should be finished
	trajectory planning in CarDriver should be continued

Steering control based turning approach
	obstacle avoidance
		calculate point beside obstacle where to pass
		I should be able to calculate the distance of the avoidance manouver (start to steer with max allowed radius by friction and max allowed by car)
		if avoidDist < obstDist, calculate an avoidance with all the available distance (how? steering control P?...no)
		if avoidDist > obstDist, start to slow down with max acc (and calculate again)
		set target normal pos for steering control, and done
	bend turn
		lane control:
			car calculates current turn radius -> get shift in given odo
			roadRadius at a given point is known. in bend roadRadius-carTurnRadius=dR gives the rate of shift. rate of shift with simInterval->delta Odo gives delta crossPos
```

TODO
--------------------------

**CarDriver**

- check car min turn radius everywhere (where driver just pushes the car along track)
- roadWidth variation
  - only in straights from start to end (next segment continues with end width!)
- signel something when maxTangentialAccel<epsilon? possibleCrash or sg?
- what if I'm on a turn, limited by centripAcc to brake for a coming, second turn, which comes after a straight segment on which I can brake fully? Somehow I should calculate decelDistance based on the road ahead... (not so hard..)
- if cruise speed is updated from gui, react to it! now only updates on new straight segment start
- decelDistance should consider currentSpeed*dT, where dT is simulation interval. can lead to tractionLoss/crash.

**Simulation**

  - catch unavoidable and final tractionLoss and crash signals from driver, relay to simView?

**Visualization, GUI**

  - separate slider for tangential accel (now +tangential and +normal are the same)
